<br>

A custom composer starter project based on the original Craft `craft` repo:

* https://github.com/craftcms/craft

To install, run:

```sh
composer create-project weareferal/craft my-site
```

The primary differences:

* Include some custom configuration scripts in `bin` and `conf`
* Include some extra plugins
* Automatically install our custom dependencies
* Include custom Tailwind CSS and JavaScript frontend Gulp files
* Automatically run a post install script to automate config

You can find full documentation on setting up a new project in the Feral Docs.
