## Miranj Craft Boilerplate

This is [Miranj's](https://miranj.in) Craft CMS boilerplate. It includes:

* Server configuration files for Apache and nginx that enable clean URLs and high performance.
* A Craft CMS configuration that lets many configuration details be controlled by [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable),
and sets the rest to the standards used at Miranj.
* A [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) based build process that uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/)
with easy custom configuration of styling.
* Miranj's preferred Craft plugins, as well as custom configurations for the same:
    - [Minify](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-minify)
    - [Imager](https://github.com/aelvan/Imager-Craft)
    - [Expanded Singles](https://github.com/verbb/expanded-singles)
    - [Redactor](https://github.com/craftcms/redactor)
    - [Inventory](https://github.com/doublesecretagency/craft-inventory)
    - [Environment Label](https://github.com/TopShelfCraft/Environment-Label)
    - [Typogrify](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-typogrify)
    - [Relabel](https://github.com/Anubarak/craft-relabel)
* Miranj's preferred JS utilities:
    - [PJAX](https://github.com/MoOx/pjax)
    - [lazySizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)
    - [Web Font Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader)
* And lastly our template hierarchy and organization.
